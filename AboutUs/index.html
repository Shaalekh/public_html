                        At QRSR, we began with a mission to make file sharing fast, simple, and accessible. Frustrated
                        by traditional methods requiring cables or emails, we developed a QR-code-powered platform for
                        effortless device connection. With a focus on simplicity, security, and user-friendliness, QRSR
                        underwent extensive research and development. Officially launched in November 2024, it allows
                        users to share files instantly with just a click and a scan. Today, QRSR empowers users globally
                        to transfer files efficiently, transforming the way we share.
